# LED Lanyard

## Introduction

My friend [Dan Stach](https://github.com/DanStach/rpi-ws2811) was the inspiration behind all of this.  From his prototype and with help from [Bricks and Minifigs of Dallas, TX](https://www.facebook.com/BAMNorthDallas/), we built the first [LEGO LED lanyard + badge holder](https://twitter.com/lastcoolname/status/1136092293801418753).  I've since extended it to be RaspberryPi controlled with the intent to Open Source/Package the design.

## Getting started

This repo is broken up into parts:

* [Parts](docs/parts.md) - If you are interested in purchasing your own, here is the list of parts necessary.
* [Assembly](docs/assembly.md) - After you have all of the parts, go here to assemble it.
* [Extending with Raspberry Pi](docs/raspberrypi.md) - The RF controller has pre-programmed effects; however, if you want to program your own, you can use your own controller.  I have created some examples with integrations to [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) and [Azure Bot Framework](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/bot-service/).
