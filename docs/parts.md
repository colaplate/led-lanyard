## Parts

If you want, you can purchase the components individually and assemble yourself.  If there's enough interest, I will offer a packaged solution.

* [14 key Wireless RF Remote + LED RGB Controller for WS2812B](https://amzn.to/2WrNkZ1)
  * This is a hardware solution to control the LED's and remote.
  * There are other remotes out there; however, I like the "Add DIY" button because it allows me to cycle through cool patterns.
  * One thing I don't like is that to control the brightness isn't intuitive (or documented).  You must select a solid color and then hold down the "Speed -/+" button to change.
* [WS2812B RGB LED Strip 144 pixels](https://amzn.to/2K5UtaP)
  * This is where the magic happens.
  * 1m, 144 pixels seems to provide the best patterns
  * There are 3 types of shielding when ordering:
    * IP30 (no shielding) allows for maximum flexibility; however, is the most likely to break
    * IP65 is nice but is stiffer and the silicone shielding makes it tricky to feed through the webbing.
    * IP67 would not fit throught the webbing, but is waterproof
* [Portable battery](https://amzn.to/2I4XtBS)
  * You can use an existing power bank if you don't want to purchase
  * There are batteries which hold more power; however, I wanted the lightest battery I could find
* [5.5mm x 2.1mm Barrel Jack to Micro-USB Cable](https://amzn.to/2F0102G)
  * USB Power Bank bone connects to the LED Controller bone.
* [4"x6" Craft Case](https://amzn.to/2ICOuYP)
  * This will hold the electronics and battery
* [4"x6" Vinyl Envelope](https://amzn.to/2Na9YRd)
  * Since most badges are 4"x6" or less, this should be able to accomodate most badges provided by conferences.
* [4"x6" Index Card](https://amzn.to/2X1W3Bi)
  * Optional.  You only need 1.  This is to provider a backer for the badge and hide the electronics.
* [Hand Riveter Set](https://amzn.to/2IDv6uS)
  * Somewhat optional; however, this is the best solution I found for affixing the badge sleeve to the craft case.  Optionally, you could use Super Glue or E6000; however, it does not adhere well.
* [Tubular Polyester Webbing](https://www.strapworks.com/product_p/stpw1.htm)
  * You'll need at least 4 feet.  White diffuses the light better, but black has a better aesthetic, IMO.
* Wire cutters
* Matches
  * Used to remove frays from the webbing
