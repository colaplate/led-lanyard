# Assembly

**DISCLAIMER:  I am not an electrical engineer.  Please use with caution.**

**WARNING!  Pulling too much current may cause controller to freeze.  This can happen when LEDs are on full brightness or when displaying white (which is all 3 RGB LED's running at the same time).  Unplug battery and plug back in to reset.**

1. Verify equipment works.
    1. Remove LED strip from case and barrel.  KEEP CASE AND BARREL.  You will keep the LEDs in this for storage.
    1. Plug LED strip into LED Controller.  
    1. Plug LED Controller into Barrel Jack cable
    1. Plug Barrel Jack cable into Portable Battery
    1. Using remote, turn on controller
    1. Change brightness to ~50%.  Instructions are unclear:  Press the R button and hold the "Speed -" button till the lights are dimmer.
    1. Now experiment with the "Mode" buttons to find patterns you like.  You can add them by pressing the "ADD DIY" button for later use.
    1. Disassemble for next steps
1. Cut webbing to 42".  Cut any loose frays and burn with fire from matches
1. Add dab of hot glue, 1.5" inches from each end of webbing.  (Doesn't need to be pretty)
1. Cut extra wires off of LED strip so that only connection to controller still exists. (Not needed for this build and will take up space)
1. Feed LED strip into webbing
1. Reconnect LED strip to LED Controller, Barrel Jack cable and Portable Battery.  Turn on controller to test again.
1. Connect LED lanyard to badge.  This can be done through a few ways:
    1. Build custom LEGO case to feed lanyard into case and hold battery + cabling
    1. Hot glue battery + cabling to badge provided.  Some on-site field work would be required.
